# RPG Game

This is a console-based Role-Playing Game (RPG) implemented in C#. The game allows a player to choose an opponent and attack them using different types of attacks.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. `RPG_Game`: This is the main game application. It initializes and starts the game.

2. `RPG_GameLogic`: This contains the game logic, including units, attacks, factories for creating units and attacks, and the game management logic.

## How to Run

To run the game, you need to have .NET installed on your machine. Once you have .NET installed, you can run the game using the following command:

```sh
dotnet run --project RPG_Game/RPG_Game.csproj
```
